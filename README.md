# Dog-Breed-Prediction
This project hopes to identify dog breeds from images. The goal is to build a model capable of doing breed prediction of a dog by just “looking” into its image. We build a prediction model based on modern machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and publicly available datasets and pre-trained models for image recognition so that the task could be solved with a pretty good accuracy.
Models and API used: Mobilenet Classifier,Tensorflow,Keras API
